# Querying-a-Music-Store-Database

In this project, I have queried the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store, including sales as well as track, album and artist data. For this project, I will be analyzing the media in the store, the customers and employees of the store, and their invoice information. 

I have attempted to answer the following 4 questions and created visualizations to communicate the findings:
1. Which are the most popular artists by number of tracks sold?
2. Which are the most popular genres by number of tracks sold?
3. What is the percentage of sales by country?
4. What are the sales figures by year?

The schema for the Chinook Database is provided below. You can see the columns that link tables together via the arrows.
